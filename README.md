> Initially I had the same issue as the previous assignments. The program would not compile despite following the instructions. I did figure it all out though, as well as git and github. A major issue I had with this assignment was the lack of specific guidance. The instructions were confusing as building an app with a factory design pattern whould have been simple enough if not for the instructions. I felt as if this assignment's prompt could have been handled better. But, what is done is done.
